Front End Developer Test for Mi-C3

Justifications

1. React Router was initially setup but was removed as the required functionality was achieved without the need for react router and thus the extra dependency was removed reducing the size of the final bundle.   
2. Redux, while redux is a useful tool, it was designed to solve a specific problem, namely complex and unwieldy local state. The current implementation of this app does not suffer from said problem and therefore  Redux would only add additional boilerplate and unnecessary complexity with little benefit.  it was therefore not used.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
